Project Repository README
Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and programs demonstrating various data handling, analysis, and visualization techniques. The projects span web scraping, financial data extraction, music library management, GDP data processing, and basic calculations. These scripts are designed to support learning and practical application in data science, business intelligence (BI), and financial analysis.
Contents
1. Extracting Stock Data Using a Web Scraping

File: Extracting Stock Data Using a Web Scraping.txt
Description: Demonstrates web scraping to extract stock data (e.g., Netflix) using requests and BeautifulSoup. The script creates a pandas DataFrame with stock metrics (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) and compares it with data loaded via pd.read_html.
Dependencies: pandas, requests, bs4, html5lib, lxml, plotly
Usage: Run to fetch and display Netflix stock data from a specified URL.

2. Music Library

File: music_library.txt
Description: A program to manage and analyze a music album collection. It includes functions for calculating scores, genre frequency, album ratings, and printing high-rated albums using loops, dictionaries, and variable scope.
Features:
calculate_score: Computes a score based on rating and bonus.
get_genre_frequency: Counts genre occurrences.
rate_album: Rates albums based on a favorite band.
print_high_rated_albums: Displays albums above a rating threshold.
print_album_info: Shows album details.
freq: Counts word frequency in lyrics.


Usage: Execute main() to see the functionality with sample album data.

3. Extracting Stock Market Data Using Python

File: Extracting Stock Market Data Using Python.txt
Description: Uses the yfinance library to download historical stock data (e.g., Apple) and visualizes it with matplotlib. Includes dividend data and JSON file handling.
Dependencies: yfinance, matplotlib, pandas
Usage: Run to fetch and plot Apple stock price and dividend data.

4. Modifying the .txt Files

File: modifying the .txt files.txt
Description: Manages membership data by generating and cleaning files (members.txt and inactive.txt). Uses random data generation and file operations to simulate membership status updates.
Functions:
genFiles: Creates initial membership files.
cleanFiles: Moves inactive members to a separate file.


Usage: Execute to generate and clean membership data, then print active and inactive members.

5. The GDP Scraper

File: the GDP scraper.txt
Description: Scrapes GDP data from a Wikipedia archive using pandas.read_html and processes it to list the top 10 economies. Saves results to a CSV file.
Dependencies: numpy, pandas
Usage: Run to fetch and save GDP data for the top 10 economies.

6. yfinance Library

File: yfinance library.txt
Description: A simple script using yfinance to download historical data for Microsoft (MSFT) stock.
Dependencies: yfinance, pandas
Usage: Execute to display Microsoft stock data.

7. Basic Calculator

File: basic calculator.txt
Description: A simple calculator performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with error handling.
Usage: Run and input numbers and operation to calculate results.

Setup Instructions

Install Dependencies:
Run the !pip install commands provided in each script (e.g., pandas, requests, yfinance, etc.) in a Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook or terminal).


Required Tools:
Python 3.x
Internet connection for web scraping and API calls


File Execution:
Copy each script into a .py file or run directly in a Python environment.
Ensure proper file paths (e.g., apple.json for stock data) are accessible.



Usage

Each script can be run independently to explore its functionality.
Modify URLs, data sources, or parameters (e.g., stock symbols, GDP URLs) as needed for your use case.
For visualization scripts, ensure a display environment is available (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
